# machine-learning-challenge
**Machine Learning Homework:** This project focused on taking potential exoplanet measurement data & using machine learning libraries to create a model that will successfully predict an outcome with new data at a 90% success rate.

**models:**
- julia_brunett.sav: Best model created to predict new exoplanets

**resources:**
- exoplanet_data.csv: Original data file with exoplanet measurement data

***model_1.ipynb***
- Random Tree Classifier model
- Uses sklearn

***model_2.ipynb***
- Deep Learning Classifier model
- Uses Keras & TensorFlow

Create a README that reports a comparison of each model's performance as well as a summary about your findings and any assumptions you can make based on your model (is your model good enough to predict new exoplanets? Why or why not? What would make your model be better at predicting new exoplanets?).
